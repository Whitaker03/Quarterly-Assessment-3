# Quarterly-Assessment-3
This is my DS3850 quarterly assessment 3. In this assessment, we’ll be creating a GUI for our Quiz Bowl
Project. The graphical user interface is only necessary for the user (the one
taking the quiz). Populating the database does not have to be done in a GUI
format, nor does reading the data stored inside the database (though those
files are obviously needed for you to manage the program). In other words,
you’re the programmer. You set up the database in the back-end. The user is
given a GUI to interact with. You should be able to give this GUI to a user that
does not have any coding knowledge. The courses are DS3850-intro to python. DS3860-Business Database Management. DS3810-Programming Logic and analytic thinking. LAW2810- Business legal enviroment and ethics. MKT3400-Priciples of marketing.
